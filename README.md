### Top-down shooter: https://doh09.github.io/
#### Development info
  - A hobby project I worked on.
  - Made in Unity with C#
  - The game code is not shown in a public repository as it is private. I did want to share how it turned out though.
  - The game can take a little time to load/start as it was deployed before Unity's newer more efficient web deployment came along.
  
### Controls
  - WASD for movement.
  - Mouse for aiming.
  - Space for shooting.
  - Click on items/weapons to pick them up.
  - Drag and drop in inventory to equip items.
  
#### Features
  - Character design.
  - Enemy spawn, follow & attack.
  - Player shoot & change weapons with inventory.
  - A small city area to walk around in.
  
 
Currently no more projects are hosted live, but I intend to get the Quotes emailer online and perhaps the MyBooks project.

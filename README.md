### Top-down shooter: https://doh09.github.io/
#### Development info
  - A hobby project I worked on.
  - Made in Unity with C#
  - The game code is not shown in a public repository as it is private. I did want to share how it turned out though.
  
#### Features
  - Character design.
  - Enemy spawn, follow & attack.
  - Player shoot & change weapons with inventory.
  - A small city area to walk around in.
 
Currently no more projects are hosted live, but I intend to get the Quotes emailer online and perhaps the MyBooks project.
